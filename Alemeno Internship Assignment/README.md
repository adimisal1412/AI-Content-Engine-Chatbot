System Architecture and Methodology
1. System Architecture Overview
The AI Content Engine is designed to be scalable, modular, and efficient. It processes and stores document embeddings for fast retrieval using FAISS, and provides a chatbot interface for user interaction.

Local LLM: The system runs a locally hosted GPT-2 model to generate insights from documents, ensuring data privacy.
Vector Store (FAISS): Document embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and stored in a FAISS index for efficient querying.
Streamlit Chatbot Interface: Users interact with the system through a Streamlit chatbot, where they can input queries and retrieve relevant insights from documents.
2. Methodology
Document Ingestion:

PDF documents are placed in the data/ folder.
Text is extracted from the PDFs using the PyMuPDF library.
Embedding Generation:

The extracted text is passed through the Sentence Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate high-quality text embeddings.
Embeddings are generated in batches for efficiency.
FAISS Index Creation:

Embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast retrieval during querying.
The FAISS index allows the system to efficiently retrieve relevant documents based on the semantic similarity of the user’s query.
Retrieval and Insight Generation:

The system uses LangChain's RetrievalQA to find the most relevant documents from the FAISS index.
The retrieved documents are used as context, and the GPT-2 model generates insights or answers to the user’s queries.
Chatbot Interaction:

Users interact with the system through a Streamlit chatbot, where they input their queries.
The chatbot retrieves relevant documents from the FAISS index and generates a response using the GPT-2 model.
User Guide for Streamlit Chatbot Interface
1. Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-content-engine.git
cd ai-content-engine
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Data: Place your PDF documents in the data/ directory. These documents will be processed for text extraction and embeddings generation.

2. Running the Chatbot
Start the Streamlit App: To start the chatbot interface, run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
This will launch the chatbot interface in your default browser.

Interface Overview:

Query Input: Users can type their questions or queries related to the content of the PDF documents (e.g., "What are the key takeaways from document X?").
Document Retrieval: The system retrieves relevant documents from the FAISS index based on the query.
Insight Generation: The system uses GPT-2 to generate insights or summaries from the retrieved documents, which are displayed in the interface.
3. Querying the System
After entering a query, the system processes the query by searching for the most relevant documents using the FAISS index.
Once the documents are retrieved, the GPT-2 model generates a response based on the content of the documents.
The response is displayed directly in the chatbot interface for easy access.
4. Customization and Extensions
You can extend the system by replacing the current models with more advanced language models or modifying the document processing pipeline.
The retriever can be fine-tuned to prioritize certain documents or sections, depending on the use case.
